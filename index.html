                My coding journey started in my schooling days in 2011 when I opt Informatics Practices as my optional
                subject. After that, I pursued Computer Applications in my Bachelor's and completed with first-class
                honours then I went for Master's and finished it with first-class Too.
                <!-- I've been working in the industry

                I play cricket usually or some other sport like snooker, soccer, tennis to name a few.
