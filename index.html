            <p>
                Not all heroes wear capes. During the novel coronavirus pandemic, the real heroes wear scrubs.
                Home-quarantined citizens are expressing love for the doctors and nurses on the front lines of the
                global COVID-19 outbreak, even as it spreads across much of the world. Shouts and applause are ringing
                out in many locked-down cities, and social media is being flooded with messages of support for those
                braving the outbreak to help others.

            "Many social media users praised healthcare workers while invoking the words of Mr. Rogers, who once offered
            a bit of advice for responding to scary news situations."
